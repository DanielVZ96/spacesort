# Spacesort
âœ¨ Fast sorting using space

This is a sorting algorithm that mixes comparative and non-comparative methods depending 
on the input's characteristics (length, range of values, min-max values, etc.). It mainly makes 
use of variations of the counting sort algorithm, but also fallbacks to comparison based algorithms 
in cases they are expected to be faster.
